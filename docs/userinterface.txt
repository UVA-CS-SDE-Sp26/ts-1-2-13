Instructions:
1. The program should be run from the class TopSecret… e.g., using the command:
 java topsecret

When the program runs with no arguments, it should list the numbered files available to display. E.g.:
01 filea.txt
02 fileb.txt
03 filec.txt

2. When the program runs with a number as an argument, the contents of the corresponding file is displayed on screen.
 java topsecret 01
(this displays on screen the contents of the file filea.txt)

The program exits after showing the file list, the contents of an indicated file, or after displaying an error message.

Tasks:
1. Program is run “java topsecret” with no args
2. Program is run “java topsecret 01” with 1 arg
3. Error messages in case of invalid inputs

folderContents = getFiles(folderPath)
Int counter = 0
For files in folderContents:
	counter+=1

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Task #2: Program is run “java topsecret 01” with 1 arg
