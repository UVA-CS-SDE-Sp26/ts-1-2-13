The Cipher class deciphers ciphered text using a substitution key.
The cipher key is stored in a file named key.txt inside the ciphers folder.
The key file contains two lines - the first line contains the actual characters and the
second line contains the ciphered equivalents. The key is validated before being used.
The Cipher class accepts a ciphered string and returns the deciphered result.

UML:

Cipher
------------------------------------------------
-actualChars: char[]
-cipherChars: char[]
------------------------------------------------
+Cipher(): void
+Cipher(keyPath: String): void
-loadKey(path: String): void
-validateKey(): void
-noDuplicates(arr: char[]): void
+decipher(cipherText: String): String

PSEUDOCODE:

constructor Cipher():
    call loadKey("ciphers/key.txt")

constructor Cipher(String keyPath):
    call loadKey(keyPath)

function loadKey(String path):
    if file does not exist
        throw error

    read all lines from file at path

    if file has fewer than 2 lines:
        throw error

    actualLine = first line trimmed
    cipherLine = second line trimmed

    if actualLine is empty OR cipherLine is empty:
        throw error

    if length(actualLine) != length(cipherLine):
        throw error

    actualChars = convert actualLine to char array
    cipherChars = convert cipherLine to char array

    call validateKey()

function validateKey():
    call noDuplicates(plainChars)
    call noDuplicates(cipherChars)

function noDuplicates(char[] arr):
    for i from 0 to length(arr) - 1:
        for j from i + 1 to length(arr) - 1:
            if arr[i] == arr[j]:
                throw error

function decipher(String cipherText):
    result = empty string

    for each character ch in cipherText:
        found = false

        for i from 0 to length(cipherChars) - 1:
            if cipherChars[i] == ch:
                append actualChars[i] to result
                found = true
                break

        if found is false:
            append ch to result

    return result

Key File Format:

The key file must contain exactly two lines.

Line 1: Actual characters
Line 2: Cipher characters

Each character in line 2 matches to the character at the same index in line 1.

Example key.txt file:

abcdefghijklmnopqurstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQURSTUVWXYZ1234567890
bcdefghijklmnopqurstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQURSTUVWXYZ1234567890a


TESTS:

-loadKey(path: String): void

-validateKey(): void
-noDuplicates(arr: char[]): void



+decipher(cipherText: String): String

-loading a valid key file initializes the cipher correctly
-loading a key file with different length lines throws an error
-loading a key file with duplicate characters throws an error
-deciphering a known ciphered string returns the correct plaintext
-characters not present in the cipher key (spaces, punctuation, symbols) remain unchanged
-using an alternate key path produces different deciphered output
-missing or unreadable key file results in an error
